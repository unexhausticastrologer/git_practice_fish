Note: Fish standard length (SL) data were measured directly in some experiments (e.g., 2016) and estimated from regression relationships in others.  
For example, the Acanthochromis polyacanthus used in choice flume experiments in 2015 arrived in the lab at a very uniform size, and batches of fish 
were sacrificed from holding tanks at various timepoints throughout the study.  Regressions of SL vs. time were then used to estimate the SL of each 
of the fish used in experimental trials, as we did not want to risk harming these fragile fish by taking length measurements.  Fish SL in the 2014 flume 
data was measured from the video footage and then a post hoc calibration relationship was formulated for measured SL and footage-derived SL, to enable 
an estimate of the former from the latter for each of the experimental fish.  Excess decimal places have been retained in the dataset in instances where 
SL has been calculated rather than measured. This also explains the repeat values of SL for different individuals with excess decimal places.
